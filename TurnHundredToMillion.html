                    <p>Real millionaires don't live fancily. They usually live under their means and stay under the radar.
                       This is because millionaires are people who <strong>save</strong>, not <strong>spend</strong>.
                       This is good because it means that anybody can become a millionaire even if you've never saved once in your
                      life. The first step is working towards your Million-Dollar-Mindset(MDM) which is, more than anything, about 
                      attitude. It requires you to truly commit to making a million bucks. Sticking to a financial plan over time can
                      be pretty challenging. There is temptation everywhere. So many places to spend your money on, but the secret
                      to saving is not buying the latest trends. Saving is part of the MDM, but the MDM also means you can stay
                      <strong>Focused</strong> even after setbacks, <strong>Patient</strong>, <strong>Confident</strong> through a
                      independent mind-set, and <strong>Knowledgable</strong> about money. You need to make MDM a part of your habit.
                      You need to put away some money to savings every day, even if it is just a dollar or even half that. You also need
                      to learn from failure and not let it discourage you. This book will hold your hand through each step of creating
                      your own plan to become financially independent, but before that, you need to be willing to commit. So, say these 
                      words out loud: <blockquote class="capital font-weight-bold"><mark>"I Will Become A Millionaire"</mark></blockquote>

                    <p>You can live the life you want by having money which means you need a plan, 
                      with financial goals. Financial Goals will keep you on the right path and help
                       you to make a million bucks. There are three types of financial goals: <strong>
                        Short-Term Goals</strong> which account from now to 1 year from now, 
                        <strong>Medium-Term Goals</strong> which account from 1 to 10 years, and <strong>
                          Long-Term Goals</strong> which account for any period over 10 years. Buying a 
                          new phone, or supplies to start a new business are examples of short term goals.
                           Buying a car, or saving for college is an example of medium-term goal. Buying a house,
                            or travelling the world is an example of a long-term goal. Next, you need to write down
                             your goals and place them where you can see them everyday. This will give you
                              motivation to continue on. You can always revise your goals whenever you want.
                               After setting your goals, you need to check your progress on a regular basis and 
                               adjust your goals or lifestyle accordingly. Setting financial goals and monitoring 
                               your progress daily is the foundation for your financial future.</p>

                    <p>If you want to reach your financials goals(described in chapter 2), you are going to need a budget which is going to serve as your financial road map. A budget is a tool which can help you live within your means. You can make a budget by estimating your income for the budget period and compare that to your expenses for the budget period. Ex: for a monthly budget, you estimate your monthly income and compare it to your monthly expenses. This is why receipts are important. They can help you remember your expenses for a more accurate budget. If your expenses end up being more than your income, you can do 3 things:
                      <ul>
                        <li class="small-caps"><mark>Increase Your Income</mark></li>
                        <li class="small-caps"><mark>Cut back on expenses</mark></li>
                        <li class="small-caps"><mark>Do a little of both</mark></li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As your budget expands, you should add a seperate line for an emergency fund which should contain for three to six month's worth of income. Your budget will constantly need adjustment, but knowing how to budget is a gift which will stick with you for the rest of your life.

                    <!--Body content here-->
                    <p>There are 5 main ways to make money. They are: <strong>Getting a Allowance</strong>, <strong>Working for Money</strong>, <strong>Getting a gift</strong>, <strong>Borrowing Money</strong>, and <strong>Earning Interest on Investments</strong>.<br>
                      <strong class="small-caps">Allowance: </strong> According to <i>Time Magazine</i>, 61% of American Parents give their children an allowance which could greatly help you in achieving your short-term goals if you are in that majority. You can maximize your allowance by asking for a raise and deciding how much to dedicate to each category: <strong>saving</strong>, <strong>spending</strong>, and <strong>sharing</strong>. If you don't get an allowance, you can try asking for it and if that doesn't work, then you can try the other ways of earning money.<br>
                      <strong class="small-caps">Working: </strong> You can start working towards earning money by doing a job or start a business(covered in chapter 5 and 6), but you can also start small. You could do extra jobs around the house or ask around the neighborhood for any jobs.<br>
                      <strong class="small-caps">Gifts: </strong> Sometimes people just give you money. You can get money from Grandma or from your parents for achieving something great. This money can count as Income and should be deposited in your savings account. It doesn't have to be all the money, but a good chunk of money. You should always refer to your budget as your anchor to keep you from being lost in financial fantasy when you get an unexpected chunk of change.<br>
                      <strong class="small-caps">Borrowing: </strong> Borrowing money is usually a bad idea. When borrowing money, the lender will want interst in return. Borrowing is good for big purchases such as a house, but not for turning a $100 into a $1,000,000.<br>
                      <strong class="small-caps">Interest on Investments: </strong> This is one of the most effective methods of making that million bucks. When you make a investment with a financial institution, your money is put into a savings account which accrues interest. Investments are purchased with the expectation that it will generate income or go up in value in the future. Investments allow your money to work for you. Your first step should be to put money in a savings account at a bank or credit union. Later on, you can invest in other investments such as stocks and real estate(covered in chapter 9).
